# week2parkinggarageproject
This repo contains the parking garage project for week 2. 

The objective of the project was to write a an object-oriented Python program for customer admission into a parking garage.
It was a pair programming project completed by myself and Celeste Barrios-Cruz.

I created the initial repository. 



The following tasks were completed by me:

1st commit:
Commited the initial VS code file to the repository. 

3rd commit:
Methods named takeTicket, payForParking and leaveGarage were added within the ParkingGarage() class. 
I commented in a detailed but rough outline of all the actions needed in each method to make the program run successfully and achieve objectives.

5th commit:
I continue debugging the pay sequence of the code (more specifically the takeTicket method).
I renamed variables for more consistency throughout the code and readability.

7th and 8th commits:
I completed styling for the final project, making sure spacing, indentation, capitalization, etc. were all consistent throughout. 
I changed several variables that were coded as attributes.  
Final debugging of the while loop inside the Run() function was completed so that the lists and dictionary would not clear after each loop.
I verified that the code ran successfully in all possible scenarios.
